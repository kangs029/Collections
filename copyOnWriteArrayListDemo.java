        // instead of directly modifying the existing list
        // a new copy of the list is created, and the modification is applied to that copy

        // Read Operations: Fast and direct, since they happen on a stable list without interference from modifications.
        // Write Operations: A new copy of the list is created for every modification.
        //The reference to the list is then updated so that subsequent reads use this new list.
